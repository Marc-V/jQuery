                <p class="one">Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
                <p class="two">Shut up and take my money! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Shinier than yours, meatbag. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
                <p class="three">Noooooo! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
                <p class="four">Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. She also liked to shut up! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
                <p class="five">Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Bender?! You stole the atom. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! How much did you make me?</p>
                <div id="fourth-uno">    
                    <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
                    No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
                    That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Now what? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Daylight and everything.
                    Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Your best is an idiot! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
                    How much did you make me? Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I can explain. It's very valuable. Bender?! You stole the atom. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
                    WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Why did you bring us here? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>
